# libpep
Policy enforcement point library from [ngac sos](https://github.com/esen96/sos-ngac). This library can be loaded into any java spring arrowhead system. In order to get the orchestration process validated, the system containing this module needs to be authorized to consume the policy server query interface service. This is done by adding the corresponding authorization rules to the arrowhead database in your system, see the [arrowhead documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-arrowhead/core-java-spring) for instructions on how this is done.
